# Note

Inside the generator function, we use a special keyword called **yield** which is used to pause the function inside itself.

A generator function can be stopped and restarted as many times as we like.With normal functions, we get parameters in
the beginning and a return statement in the end. With generator functions, you send messages out with each yield, and
you send messages back in with each restart.
